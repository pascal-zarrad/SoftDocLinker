# SoftDocLinker

SoftDocLinker (Software Documentation Linker) is a place where all relevant software documentation can be linked together.
It can be hard to maintain dozens of documentation for different projects while providing a central place to view them.

SoftDocLinker aims to solve this problem with a huge simplicity. It has been build to make it as easy as possible to have a
dynamic page for your documentations on GitHub Pages without any external service.

### Q & A

Q: Is it possible to use SoftDocLinker on an external Webserver which does not run on GitHub Pages?

A: Yes, it is! Look at "Install on a Webserver" for further information.

Q: How is it possible to have a dynamic page on GitHub Pages without a backend?

A: We're using a JSon file to store the required Meta-Data which is then requested using an AJAX request.
So you just have to modify the JSon file and push your changes to GitHub to update anything.

### Install on GitHub Pages

 1. Download the latest release (under "releases") or clone this repo and compile it using NodeJS & NPM with the command ```npm run release``` and use the content of the ```dist/``` folder.
 2. If you downloaded the latest release add it to the GitHub repository of your GitHub pages repository.
 3. Edit the ```cfg/cfg.json``` and ```cfg/docs.json``` to fit your requirements. Additional info can be found under the paragraph "Customization"!
 4. Upload the Page onto your Web-Server!

 2. Edit the ```cfg/cfg.json``` and ```cfg/docs.json``` to fit your requirements. Additional info can be found under the paragraph "Customization"!
 4. Push the page.
 5. Just edit the ```cfg/docs.json``` at any time and push your changes to update your page!

### Customization

You can change the favicon by replacing the favicon at ```img/icon.png```.
You can customize a lot of things in the ```cfg.json``` located at ```cfg/cfg.json```.

**List of all available configuration options in ```cfg.json```:**

Option | Description
------------ | -------------
pageTitle | Change the text displayed in the tab next to the favicon
navbarBrand | The text displayed in the navigation bar as brand
navbarButtons | Can be used to create custom links in the navigation bar. By default a "Back to Home" link that can also be removed is configured. There's no limit on how many buttons you can create. All buttons follow the following JSon scheme: ```{"displayText": "Back to Home", "icon": "fa-home", "target: "https://github.com/PlayerForceHD/SoftDocLinker"}```. ```displayText``` is the text displayed to the user. ```icon``` is the icon at the left side of the button, you can simply set the value to ```none``` or fully remove it to set no icon. ```target``` is the URL where the button will point to.

**The ```docs.json``` and it's content**

Just look into the docs.json. All available arguments are self-explaining.
Simply add another object to the JSon array as normally.
You can add an unlimited amount of documentations.

### Building the project

To build this project, you must have installed NPM.
Simply run ```npm run build``` (or ```yarn run build```, if you're using yarn).
It will (re)build the app.js that provides the required logic for SoftDocLinker to run.
After running the build command, your required files are located in the ```dist/``` folder!

### I want to make SoftDocLinker better!

SoftDocLinker is a simple project, so just make your changes and create a pull request.
When your changes are nice, they will be accepted and merged.

You can add anything you want or what you think that should be implemented, as long as it makes sense.
There're only two restrictions: Everything needs to be compatible to GitHub Pages.
